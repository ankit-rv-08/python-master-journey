# python-master-journey

Welcome to my Python learning journey, where Iâ€™m building a solid foundation for software engineering, AI, and automation.

## ðŸš© Hour 1: Python Basics â€“ Variables, Data Types, Input/Output

[hour1_python_basics.py](hour1_python_basics.py)

This script covers the absolute basics of Python:
- Taking user input (name and age)
- Using variables and basic data types (`str`, `int`)
- Type conversion (`input()` always returns a string)
- Output formatting with f-strings


---



## ðŸš© Hour 2: Control Flow â€“ If/Else Statements

[hour2_control_flow.py](hour2_control_flow.py)

- if, elif, else statements
- Comparison operators
- Indentation and code blocks


---

## ðŸš© Hour 3: Loops â€“ For and While

[hour3_loops.py](hour3_loops.py)

- for loops, while loops
- range, iteration
- Summing numbers with loops


---


## ðŸš© Hour 4: Functions â€“ Writing, Calling, and Reusing Code
[hour4_functions.py](hour4_functions.py)
- Defined and called custom functions in Python
- Used parameters and return values
- Practiced writing docstrings for documentation
- Refactored the sum-to-N script to use a function

---

## ðŸš© Hour 5: Lists â€“ Creation, Manipulation, and Max-Finding
[hour5_lists.py](hour5_lists.py)
- Created and manipulated Python lists
- Used list comprehensions
- Iterated to find the largest value

---
##ðŸš© Hour 6: Dictionaries - CRUD
**Hour 1 Focus:**
- Created, read, updated, deleted dict entries.
- Used dictionaries for word frequency, duplicate removal.

**Scripts:**
- [`hour6_dictionary_basics.py`](hour6_Dictionaries/hour1_dictionary_basics.py)
- [`word_frequency_counter.py`](hour6_Dictionaries/word_frequency_counter.py)
- [`duplicate_remover.py`](hour6_Dictionaries/duplicate_remover.py)

**Key Learnings:**
- CRUD ops on dicts
- `.get()` for safe key access
- Practical use: fast lookups, aggregation, uniqueness

  ## Hour 2 â€“ Looping, Updating, Removing
- Practiced looping: for key, for value, for key-value (.items()).
- Used update(), del, pop(), popitem(), clear().
- Extracted keys with dict comprehension.

  Hour 3 â€“ Nested Dictionaries & Built-in Methods
Focus Areas:

Nested dictionary structure for real-world data

Applying built-in Python functions for analytics and insight

Membership checks and dictionary comprehension

Sorting and extracting complex data

ðŸš© Scripts Featured in This Module


  hour3_nested_dicts_and_builtins.py

Creating and traversing nested dictionaries

Using len(), min(), max(), sum(), all(), any(), and sorted()

Realistic data aggregation from nested structures

Examples of transforming and filtering with dict comprehensions

---
## Hour 7 â€“ List Comprehensions & Built-In Functions
[lists/hour7_list_comprehensions.py](lists/hour7_list_comprehensions.py)

- Used list comprehensions for filtering and transforming lists
- Used `map()`, `filter()`, and `enumerate()` for functional-style operations
- Performed common built-in list operations: sorting, summing, length
- Practice scripts focus on clean, idiomatic Python for interviews and production

---
## Hour 6 â€“ Tuples and Sets
[hour8_tuples_sets.py](collections/hour8_tuples_sets.py)

- Tuples: immutable, ordered collections used for fixed sequences and dict keys.
- Sets: unordered, unique collections with fast membership tests.
- Used set operations (union, intersection, difference) to solve common data tasks.
